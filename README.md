# My React Vite Template

I am learning React and Vite!

## How to clone

The command that you will run to clone the repo is this:

```sh
npx tiged <YOUR-GH-USERNAME>/my-react-vite-template#main <new-project-name>
```

(You can substitute your GitHub username for `<YOUR-GH-USERNAME>`.)

This command will create a clone of the repo' `main` branch under the name
<new-project-name> in the directory where it is run.

### Install npm

Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` at the root of the directory to install and run the project.

#### Make it your own

Customize __index.html__ to make it your own by editing the `title` - change it from "App Academy Template" to your own customized title.

Make sure the `"name"` section of __package.json__ matches the project name in the command you used above.
